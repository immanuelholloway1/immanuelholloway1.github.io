<h1> Hi there, my name is Immanuel </h1>
<p>What is Git? Well, git is a open source project tool. Who started Git? Git was started by Linus Torvalds. What is a Hub? A hub is a  basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices together. Describe repository and its role?  A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, and is used for easy access to files so you won't have to travel over a network. My Thoughts on GitHub: GitHub is a open source project tool that connect people and it is changing how we do things.  </p>
